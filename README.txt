  ABOUT TECHNOLOGIC CHOICES FOR THE EXERCISES
**************************************************************

--------------------------------------------------------------
 TASK #1 - Docker.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Docker configuration files define their own technologic standards and requirements.
So there is no technologic choice to mention here. Just using what's required.


--------------------------------------------------------------
 TASK #2 - Problem solving.
--------------------------------------------------------------
PHP is the natural choice here for me because it's the language I know the best.
That's also the one that was used for a pair of API-Platform/Swagger tutorial I did some times ago.
And so it seems one of the appropriate choices to be easy integrable for next exercise.

I will **NOT** use Laravel because I haven't used it yet, and I have not enough time to learn it for this test.
That's why I'll just use plain PHP, which is sufficient for the requirements and the more straightforward for me.
The code therefore will not include unit tests nor functionnal tests, which could perhaps have been more easily included using Laravel.
Laravel would provide a better and more extensible "real world" framework solution.

--------------------------------------------------------------
 TASK #3 - Bonus.
--------------------------------------------------------------
I'll use nothing because I will not have enough time to make this.
If I did, I would have used PHP API framework API-Platform (built over Symfony) because that's the solution I already tested - and it's fine. 
A lighter solution with another technology could be better here though, because this one, built over Symfony, still carries a lot of code.
